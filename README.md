# Starter folder

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Open Data Toronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was used for the analysis presented.
-   `other` contains LLM interaction documentation and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage
Aspects of this code were edited and debugged with the assistance of the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT-3.5. The entire interaction history can be found in `other/llm/usage.txt`
